You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. Find the maximum value of the expression |Ax−Ay|+|Ay−Az|+|Az−Ax| over all triples of pairwise distinct valid indices (x,y,z).

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum value of |Ax−Ay|+|Ay−Az|+|Az−Ax|.

Constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The value of the expression is always 10. For example, let x=1, y=2 and z=3, then it is |2−7|+|7−5|+|5−2|=5+2+3=10.

Example case 2: Since all values in the sequence are the same, the value of the expression is always 0.

Example case 3: One optimal solution is x=1, y=2 and z=5, which gives  |2−2|+|2−5|+|5−2|=0+3+3=6 .
